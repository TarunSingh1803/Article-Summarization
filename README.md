# AI Article Summarizer

An interactive Streamlit app that summarizes long-form text from pasted input or fetched web articles using a distilled BART model, and then suggests simple related topics based on the generated summary.

## Features
- Paste text or enter a URL; the app fetches paragraphs from the page and prepares the text for summarization.
- Fast, news-style summarization powered by `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` from Hugging Face Transformers.
- Lightweight ‚ÄúRelated Articles‚Äù suggestions derived from early summary keywords for quick exploration.
- Clean Streamlit UI with session state so fetched or edited text persists across interactions.

## Tech stack
- **Streamlit** ‚Äî web UI framework for interactive app building.  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** ‚Äî summarization model `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` using `BartTokenizer` + `BartForConditionalGeneration`.  
- **PyTorch** ‚Äî inference backend for the model.  
- **Requests + BeautifulSoup4** ‚Äî HTTP fetching and HTML parsing for articles.  
- **scikit-learn, ROUGE, YAKE, NLTK** ‚Äî used in the exploratory notebook for keyword extraction, evaluation, and experimentation.  

## Project structure
- `app.py` ‚Äî Streamlit app: model loading, URL fetching, text input, summarization, and related items UI.
- `article_web.ipynb` ‚Äî Exploration: model init, scraping helper, keyword extraction, TF-IDF related-article matching, ROUGE, and local model save.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Pinned dependencies for reproducible installs.

## Getting started (local)
1) Environment setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Run
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3) Use
- Select ‚Äú‚úçÔ∏è Paste Text‚Äù to input content or ‚Äúüåê Enter URL‚Äù to fetch an article, then click ‚Äú‚ú® Generate Summary.‚Äù

## Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)
- Push this repo to GitHub with `app.py` at the root and `requirements.txt` included.
- Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), click ‚ÄúCreate app,‚Äù choose the repo/branch, and set `app.py` as the entrypoint.
- Optional: Choose a custom subdomain during setup, then update the README badge link to the final URL.

## Notes and limitations
- The distilBART model trades some quality for speed; performance is strongest on news-style content.
- Basic paragraph scraping is used; complex or script-heavy sites may yield limited or noisy text extraction.

## License and attributions
- Respect licenses for Hugging Face Transformers and the `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` model; consult their model card and library documentation for terms.
